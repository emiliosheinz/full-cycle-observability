# Full Cycle Observability

Modern systems are like airplanes, they are complex and have many moving parts. Would you fly in an airplane that doesn't have a observability? I wouldn't. The same goes for software systems, we need to have a way to monitor our systems and understand what is happening inside them so that we can make informed decisions when something goes wrong.

Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. It helps us understand what is happening inside a system from the outside and is key to building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems, specially in a microservices architecture or in big monoliths.
